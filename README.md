# Bootstrap-Portfolio

A professional portfolio site created using HTML & the Bootstrap CSS framework.

Using Bootstrap, recreated my original [portfolio site](https://meredithhazan.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/) with the following requirements:
* A navbar
* A responsive layout
* Responsive images
* A sticky footer  
* Sub-rows and sub-columns on the portfolio page
* Minimal use of media queries

Finished site can be found [here](https://meredithhazan.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/).
